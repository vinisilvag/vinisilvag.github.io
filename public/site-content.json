      "description": "cvc5 is a tool for determining the satisfiability of a first order formula modulo a first order theory (or a combination of such theories). It is the fifth in the Cooperating Validity Checker family of tools (CVC, CVC Lite, CVC3, CVC4) but does not directly incorporate code from any previous version prior to CVC4."
